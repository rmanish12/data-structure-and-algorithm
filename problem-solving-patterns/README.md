## Problem Solving Techniques

1. Frequency Counter Problem
       - This pattern uses objects or sets to collect occurrance/frequency of the values.
       - This can often avoid the use of nested loops or time complexity of O(n^2) operations with arrays/strings.
       - It can also be used to solve ***anagram*** problems, where we need to determine if a word can be formed by reshuffling the characters of a given word or not.

2. Multiple Pointer Problem
        - Creating pointer values that correspond to an index/position and move towards the beginning , end ot middle based on certain conditions.
        - Very efficient for solving problems with mimimum space complexity as well.

3. Sliding Window Problem
        - This problem involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another.
        - Depending on certain conditions, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created).
        - Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string, etc.

4. Divide and Conquer Problem
        - This pattern involves dividing a data set into smalller chunks and then repeating a process set with a subset of data.
        - This pattern can tremendously decrease the time complexity.
